My sister has known musical theatre and "Glee" star Lea Michele, for years. She first met her when she was 15, through a mutual friend. She was apparently very introverted in their first couple of meetings, but as time went on she opened up more. When people would ask her about her Broadway career (a topic that understandably interests a lot of people) she would brush off questions about it and tell them that her job "wasn't a big deal." My sister told me that she was one of the most humble, classy and gracious people she'd ever met. They stayed in contact for years, although they were never really best friends.
My sister met up with her old friends a couple of months ago at Halloween and Lea was there. She told me that Lea was incredibly sweet and seemed to show a genuine interest in my sisters life. When they were all conversing about their careers and people were commenting on how much Lea has achieved, she again brushed it aside but mentioned how her co-stars in the show helped her so much in her grieving process for Cory Monteith and how she honestly doesn't know what she would have done without them. She didn't talk a lot about herself, but seemed more interested in others. When stopped and asked for the occasional photo and autograph, she made time to mingle and chat to her fans.
When I was told this, it kind of upset me. Lea Michele has such a bad reputation for being a terrible person, but I trust my sister more than I trust the media. They have consistently painted her as an evil troll who will do anything to get all of the limelight, but my sister says she was anything but.
